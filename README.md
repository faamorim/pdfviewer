# PDFViewer

PDFViewer is my first ever UWP project. It uses the [PDFTron SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PDFTron.UWP/) to display PDF files and to convert Office (Word, Excel and PowerPoint) files to PDF to then display them.
I started by following the [Get Started](https://www.pdftron.com/documentation/uwp/get-started/integration/manually/) guide fromm the PDFTron website. I then proceeded implementing MVVM with UWP and testing the new capabilities that were not present in WPF.

Currently it only opens the files and cannot edit them.
